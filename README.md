# Continuously integrating and continuously delivering ML model and deploy it in a Kubernetes cluster in AWS
In this project, we build a **continous integration and continous delivery (CI/CD)** pipeline for ML model, and then delpoy this ML model into a **Kubernetes cluster**. We leverage the CircleCI to continuously test and build the ML model application and deliver the successful application into **Docker Hub registry**. Then we will deploy the ML model image/container from Docker Hub into the Kubernetes cluster in AWS. Another version of building a CI/CD pipeline in AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) for Machine Learning models can be referred to my repo [CICD_ML_AWS](https://github.com/cy235/CICD_ML_AWS/).
